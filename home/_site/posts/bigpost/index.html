<p>Alright, gather around children, for your old uncle Gavin has a story to tell, about the discovery of a rabbit hole leading to a rare and valuable treasure: a time capsule from an era that you probably lived through and I most certainly didn't, and dating way back before the conceptualization of the &quot;infinite canvas&quot; that led to the success of today's internationally popular &quot;Webtoons&quot;; a webcomic with a growing community of fanboys and fangirls, much like the authors whose work piqued their interest.</p>
<p>The work in question? <em>Dub This!</em>.</p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p><em>Dub This!</em> (DT! for short) is a webcomic that debuted on October 5th, 2000, and published its last &quot;episode&quot; on September 19th, 2006. It was created by Luke Morgan (aka Luke-chan, which he sometimes refers to himself as in update posts) and Scott Johnson, and they were later joined by Gabby Varry, who did the coloring from late October 2003 onward.</p>
<p>The webcomic is basically about a college anime club and a group of friends who care for it, and their misadventures as they deal with problems within their lives and their community, and fight off the evil anime-club-destroying parasite-like gang known as the Tokyo Joe! There is a story that comes to fruition as the webcomic progresses, but we will get to that later.</p>
<p>The club features a dynamic cast of characters, each based on a specific anime fan stereotype:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul - The shy anime club president, who is the main protagonist of the story.</li>
<li>Pete - Acts all manly, but secretly has a soft spot, especially for magical girl anime. Also wants to - be a mecha pilot.</li>
<li>Susie - A happy-go-lucky-looking girl who will really whoop your ass if you tick her off!</li>
<li>Ken - A &quot;sub elitist&quot; (think about the age-old subbed anime vs dubbed anime debate), and a collector of only the most genuine and authentic of anime goods from Japan, considers everyone else's stuff &quot;inferior&quot;, and his own collection just &quot;ferior&quot; (which became a joke in the comic).</li>
<li>Barry - The exact opposite of a Mary Sue, acts all woe-is-me and writes poetry as a pastime.</li>
<li>Brittany - The &quot;pretty girl&quot;, who often acts seductive towards boys, especially Barry....</li>
<li>Autumn - A transfer student that Paul falls in love with. Introduced in July 2001, makes an official appearance as a main cast member in September of the same year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you might be wondering how I discovered this rare beauty of the ancient times. Simple: I found out about it through a mahjong website. Well, specifically it was a link on the mahjong website that led to a game he developed, that had a link on the bottom to the webcomic. But what did the latter two have to do with the former? I found that out through a quick Google search.</p>
<p>Apparently, Luke-chan is a prominent figure in the riichi mahjong community; he runs his own website on mahjong strategy and news (that being the site where I found out about the game, th about DT!), moderates the mahjong subreddit, and even has a seat on the North American Riichi Mahjong Association board. I did not know about any of that until now, and I had picked up riichi mahjong and joined its community over the summer. Small world, huh!</p>
<p>Anyway, when I first stumbled upon the link to DT!, I thought it was some anime fandub service of sorts for some reason, and was initially uninterested in what it had to offer, even when I curiously opened the website to find out that it was actually a webcomic. After checking out the website, though, I decided to give it a chance. I had no idea what I was getting into, but I can safely say that it was worth it.</p>
<p>Why do I say this? What's good about it?</p>
<p>To start, the webcomic has its own website. It's not hosted on a webcomic publishing service, nor is it on a blog or a Tumblr page or anything of that sort. This was all set up by Luke-chan himself (and/or Scott), from the appearance of the site to the inner workings of the code and hosting. I love that, especially because it shows the great amounts of genuine care the creators had for the project.</p>
<p>Another thing I enjoy about the comic is how well-written the characters are. The relationships between characters, the amount of personality in each of them, even the Tokyo Joe has a hint of human in them! Admittedly, my earlier descriptions of the characters don't do them justice, basic as I made them out to be. Further elaborating on them, however, would more than likely spoil the story, which I am trying not to do writing this review. But, I digress.</p>
<p>I remember seeing a subpage somewhere in which the author explains how he writes his characters, giving them backstories and all. All of that effort into writing the characters shows throughout this webcomic, from its start as a silly 4-panel to its end in all its glory. His advice on that page is really helpful to those wanting to start their own webcomic, I'd definitely recommend checking that out!</p>
<p>The third thing that made me get really into this webcomic was the story it laid out. There was something about it that kept me unable to switch the tab or close my computer, even during class when I should've been reading the Odyssey or doing my Personal Finance classwork instead... ^^;</p>
<p>And lastly, the one thing that had me the most invested in this webcomic is a character, I have not mentioned him yet but he is one of the greatest running gags- no, the greatest character in the entire webcomic. Nobody else compares to him. It's... Bandai Guy!!! This dude is so hilarious; his random appearances, doing funny announcements like a documentary narrator, or making up fake previews of anime on his podium, always bring a smile to my face! Also, Bandai Guy is a very sexy man, I'd argue that he's the ultimate husbando, and that nobody else's looks compare to his striking beauty. I could go on forever, but that is a whole different rant that deserves its own post.</p>
<p>Anyway, moving back on topic, I'd like to get back to the story, because while I did get hooked onto the webcomic because of it, it sorta felt off in a way. Like, the switch from the one-shot &quot;episodes&quot; to the story arcs was kind of abrupt, for lack of a better word. The last two arcs back-to-back felt this way especially, the juxtaposition between the grim dark finish of the former leading into the lightheartedness of the latter felt so sudden, like I didn't have the time to process what the hell happened in the former (or in any of the arcs before it).</p>
<p>Another thing I didn't like all that much was that, if you want the full experience of DT! from start to finish, you would have to deal with the updates and sketch posts in between the main &quot;episodes&quot;, which gets infuriating at times with how it interrupts the flow of the story, even at its peaks.</p>
<p>Perhaps these two things are a fault on my end, being a naturally impatient Gen Z kid reading this on a Millennial website. In all honesty, though, these negatives never stopped me from enjoying the comic as a whole and admiring the growth of it from start to finish, from the black-and-white four-panel &quot;episodes&quot; to the full-fledged story and lovable (and loathsome) characters. Plus, the things Luke-chan has to share for updates and sketch posts are nice, though; those updates are stories in and of themselves, and give us a small look at his life outside of <em>Dub This!</em>, which would include DJing, restoring pieces of the Dead Sea Scrolls (I am not making this up, I swear on my life), and running his own anime shop (which I would really love to visit someday; Hammergirl Anime, it's called...). Talk about &quot;interesting&quot;!</p>
<p>Anyway, since I mentioned &quot;loathsome&quot; characters in the book, I feel it'd be right to explain: there is one character in the story who made my blood fucking boil. He's an antagonist, and a really good one at that. He is a liar, he is a manipulator, he is a hardcore piece of shit who doesn't care for anybody but himself, and his superiority complex beats Ken's by a long shot. The things he did to the main cast infuriated me and I wished ill will upon him so much.</p>
<p>I think that's all of it. Oh, I forgot, one last thing: there wasn't enough Bandai Guy. He deserved more &quot;episode&quot; appearances. I'd actually argue that he deserves his own spinoff webcomic, but again, I'll save that for a separate post.</p>
<p>Again, Bandai Guy is the best character in DT! and I will die on this hill even if I am the only one standing. But why am I the only one standing now? Well, it's 2023, and I only stumbled upon it by chance, and it doesn't seem like anyone has any interest in the webcomic nowadays as far as I can tell; it's been 17 years since it ended.</p>
<p>A simple look on the Wayback Machine can show us the life this webcomic and its community once had, and comments from Luke-chan in the updates can give us a mental image as well. There were a lot of captures for the main page of the site, even years after its end.</p>
<p>There was an official forum for the webcomic as well, as shown on the side navbar when you open the site. Despite it saying that it's closed because the comic's over when you click the link on the front page, the same link on other pages leads to the forum site itself, and...</p>
<p>&quot;This site can’t be reached. The server IP address could not be found.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, that's unfortunate, but not for the Wayback Machine(!), because - as surprising as the main site being archived - that forum has also been archived(!!), and some of the posts on the general discussion board alone have been archived as well(!!!)!</p>
<p>What has also been archived, and featured on the main site, are fansites dedicated to admiring, or loathing, certain characters. There was a Geocities page (Think &quot;Neocities&quot; but like before the concept of being &quot;terminally online&quot; or whatever) dedicated to Bandai Guy that I wish still existed today. Maybe I should make a similar shrine to him. There was also a fanmade RPG forum (which, I'd assume, is probably just &quot;imagine you but in DT!&quot; or &quot;act like a character you made to exist within the DT! universe&quot;, or even &quot;act like one of the characters in the DT! universe&quot;, which I honestly don't really vibe with), a Geocities page dedicated to hating the antagonist of DT!, and a fanmade gallery site of fanart from the official forum that categorizes the art by artist (whose page was hosted on a site that's also a site for a MUD/MARE (multi-user dungeon / adventure role-playing epic); perhaps the developer of the page was also a part of the dev team for that?).</p>
<p>As I went further down this rabbit hole, I made a realization: I had been getting off track and straying away from the webcomic, which turned the <em>Dub This!</em> rabbit hole I had initially found it to be, into a digressional MARE website rabbit hole. Oops....</p>
<p>When I was on track, though, I had a thought. This webcomic was pretty big, with an active forum and a community full of people who really appreciate the comic - its humor and darkness, its protagonists and antagonists, and its plot in most parts (story arcs mostly) and lack thereof in others (one-shots and sketch days) - and artists not only sending in fanart, but even at times being featured as a guest artist for a day. <em>Dub This!</em> had a community, but now that the comic ended and the forum had been closed, it can be assumed that the fans of the webcomic may have trailed away from the webcomic and forgotten about it. You can't find much information on the webcomic when you type it into Google now. All you'll get is just fandubs of other webcomics. At least the top result is <em>Dub This!</em>'s homepage...</p>
<p>I can safely say, beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt, that I missed out on what might have been a whole lot of fun, and wish I could be part of the fanboys and fangirls (can't think of a fan-something for any gender-nonconforming folks, sorry y'all ^^;) who had interest in this webcomics back when each post was being served fresh off the oven every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. But alas, I was born near the comic's end, and didn't have access to the internet until I was about 6.</p>
<p>In conclusion, even with the flaws that go against its perfections, and regardless of my fears of uneducated TikTok kids finding out about this webcomic and ruining the fun of it, I would definitely still recommend reading this webcomic from start to finish, even if that means having to deal with the interruptions from the sketch/update posts! You'll really enjoy it, or at least I hope you do.</p>
